# VulkanDeferredRendering
Vulkan deferred rendering demo, originally made for HPG course @ University of Leeds.

Improved on by adding a skybox and shadow mapping. This is by no means highly optimized code, but it works. Current implementation separates render passes inefficiently and does not make use of Vulkan's subpasses, this will be updated in future work

Output obtained:
